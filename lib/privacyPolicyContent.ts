## 2. No Cookie Policy

**We do not use cookies.**

Unlike many websites that track your movements across the internet, our website is purely informational. We do not use cookies, pixels, or trackers to monitor your behavior, serve targeted ads, or collect analytical data about your personal browsing habits.

When you visit our site, you do so anonymously until you choose to contact us directly.

### Why we collect this:
We use this information solely to:
1.  Respond to your specific trade inquiries.
2.  Generate requested quotations (Proforma Invoices).
3.  Execute export documentation (e.g., Certificates of Origin, Bills of Lading) if a contract is established.

## 4. Information Sharing

We are an export house, not a data broker. **We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others.**

We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with our business partners and trusted affiliates for the purposes outlined above.

### Operational Sharing
In the course of executing a trade order, we may share strictly necessary details with:
*   **Logistics Partners:** Freight forwarders and shipping lines to arrange cargo.
*   **Regulatory Bodies:** Customs authorities (Indian and destination country) for legal compliance.

## 5. Data Security

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information and transaction data.

---

## 6. Your Rights

As a user, you have the right to:
*   Request a copy of the business information we hold about you.
*   Request the deletion of your contact details from our internal records (unless required for ongoing legal/trade compliance).
